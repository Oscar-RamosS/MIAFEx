# Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) 
This repository contains the source code of the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx).  This novel approach enhances feature extraction by refining the classification token ([CLS] token) within the Transformer encoder. This refinement mechanism dynamically adjusts this token using learnable weights, allowing the model to prioritize salient features, crucial for medical image classification. 


# Project status
The project is currently in preparation for release. We are finalizing the codebase and documentation, and the repository will be made public shortly.
